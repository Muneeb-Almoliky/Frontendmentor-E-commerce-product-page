## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a lot about react consepts from JSX to states to conditional rendering ...etc. The somehow challenging part I faced was sharing data or state between components so I learned to tackle that by lifting up state to the parent component and learned pretty much about that.
I learned about how to sturcture your html elements and how that would affect the layout and the css styling.

### Continued development

I am willing to continue learning and buliding websites using react and dive deeper into this awesome library.
